# TODO

## Syntax Parser
- [x] Add assert, log, warning, error statements
- [ ] Add delay, file statements to testbench
- [ ] Add view to interfaces
- [ ] Module instatiation
- [ ] If define in module ports
- [ ] Add type as parameter input
- [ ] Test bench framework
- [ ] Alias?
- [ ] Add rename 
- [ ] Finish replicate operator
- [ ] How to handle time type?
- [x] Finish case statement
- [x] Add blackbox attribute to modules, functions, tasks
- [x] Distinguish between module, variable declaration, and assignment
- [x] Log AST for debug

## Library 
- [ ] Translate all base VHDL functions
- [ ] Create FDL extension library
- [ ] Create simulation extension library

## Testbench framework
- [ ] Add testbench with generic, declare, and logic blocks
- [x] Add time type
- [ ] Add 'delay' for time delay
- [ ] Add 'delay' for event driven delay
- [ ] Add 'task' for one time process
- [ ] Add 'task' for repeating time process
- [ ] Add 'routine' for sequential process that can have global variables?
- [ ] Add 'routine' for repeating sequential process?
- [ ] Simulation ends once all tasks have completed
- [ ] Call task or repeat procedure defined in library?


## Semantic checker
- [ ] Make VHDL base library
- [ ] Semantic checker with variables, types, structs, and interfaces
- [ ] Higher level semantic checking for multiple driver, unused signals, etc.

## AST Translater


## VHDL Writer
- [ ] 93 or 08 syntax
